A colourful app for festivals presentation


This is my first more complex project realized with a team at the web development course, I kept only what I worked on in github.
It is an application for festivals presentation, festivals from the entire Europe with the possibility to buy tickets.
We used vivid color palettes and dynamic elements to provide the best possible context for music and festivals theme.
